# Ding-Tink-N-Doc 
## Episode 1: The Partnership.
### Ding 'N Tink partner up with Doc to bring you their very first Discord service!

"He's perfect," said Ding in a hushed voice to his sister. 
They stood huddled together in the back room of their office discussing their newest applicant. 

"Agreed. He is the one. Our research can finally continue!" Tink struggled to contain her excitement.
Her mind was racing with ideas, plans, strategies - surely the sky is now their limit!

Ding 'N Tink emerged from the back room into the office where Dongo M.D. sat awaiting their decision excitedly. 
A warm smile spread across his face at the site of the twins. He was very interested in the research these two
had been compiling as of late; this would be an incredible learning experience to add to his resume. Just out of med school, 
he had not much been interested in working in a hospital or anything of the sort. He would make a name for himself a different way. 

"Well, Doc - you've got the job!" Ding could hardly stop himself from jumping in joy. 

"There's one problem though... Right now our research is, uh..., a bit of a mess. We've got so many files and notes spread everywhere
we can't even find what we need to continue. Our first step will be compiling all of our findings and sorting them out." Tink glanced
momentarily at her brother. It had been his job to keep their files organized. "Could you lend us a hand in organizing things around here?"

"Not a problem at all. I've got just the structure," chimed in the doctor. "We can throw all of your research into my document store!
Then, when you need anything I'll grab it for you!"

"That sounds perfect!" Ding was more than happy to rid himself of the task of storing all of their research. "You can start right now!
I'll start to round up our data and drop it off to you!"

"Right away it is." Dongo could not have been more pleased. Not only will he be able to help the infamous Ding 'N Tink with their research,
but he will also have the opportunity to read through it as he sorted it into his data store. What a tremendous turn of events!



## Note:
I know that Mongo DB was not an ideal choice for this sort of application - but I'm having fun with it ;)
